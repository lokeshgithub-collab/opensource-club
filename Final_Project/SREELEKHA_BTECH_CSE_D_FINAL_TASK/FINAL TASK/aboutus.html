                <!-- Information about the Open Source Club -->
                <p>The Open Source Club (OSC) at CRESCENT UNIVERSITY is a community of makers who want to solve problems and improve our world through open source projects. The purpose of the Open Source Club is to promote, support, and create open source software in India and beyond.</p>
                <p>The club organizes casual coding, a twice-weekly meeting dedicated to working on open source code, planning or proposing projects, or just hanging out. Occasionally, it also hosts resume reviews, guest speakers from tech companies, and competitive hackathons.</p>

                <!-- Benefits of joining the Open Source Club -->
                <p>Joining the Open Source Club is a great way to gain experience for your CV and develop a strong project portfolio. Working on open source projects or leading a group as a tech-lead positively distinguishes you from other job applicants. We also host professional development meetings, resume reviews, and presentations from tech employers (IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.).</p>
                <p>The club is also a fun way to meet up and network with people with common interests. We frequently host social events or hackathons for members to participate in.</p>

                <p>Casual coding is when the Open Source Club meets in person to work on open source code, plan or propose projects, or to just hang out. It takes place twice a week throughout the Odd and Even semesters. The dates and locations vary each semester, and are announced at the beginning of every semester and are posted on Discord before each meeting.
