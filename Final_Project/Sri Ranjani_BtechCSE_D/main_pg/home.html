    <div class="content"><p>
        Joining the Open Source Club is a great way to gain experience for your CV and develop a strong project portfolio. Working on open source projects or leading a group as a tech-lead positively distinguishes you from other job applicants. We also host professional development meetings, resume reviews, and presentations from tech employers (IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.).

The club is also a fun way to meet up and network with people with common interests. We frequently host social events or hackathons for members to participate in.
